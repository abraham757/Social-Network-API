# 17 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Your Task

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, you'll use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it's important that you understand how to build and structure the API first.

## Social Media Website

### Description

This project is a backend server for a social network web application that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' posts, and build a friend list. Built with **Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose**, the server efficiently handles user interactions, data storage, and routing. It supports thought creation, reactions, and friend connections while ensuring smooth and scalable performance. Additionally, timestamps can be formatted using a JavaScript date library or the native Date object. This backend serves as the foundation for an interactive and engaging social networking experience.
